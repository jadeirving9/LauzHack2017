# LauzHack2017
Our LauzHack 2017 Project involved building an AR Menu Scanner app in Unity and Vuforia. The aim was to produce an app that would allow a customer to view food on a menu before ordering, with a quick scan of the AR code with their phone. 


We had problems building the app, however, we have a working demo. 

We could not post our project on GitHub as the file is too large. Most of the project involved 3D models and high resolution images, which GitHub does not allow.
